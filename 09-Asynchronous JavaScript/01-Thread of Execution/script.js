/** Thread of Execution
 * Events are asynchronous
 * At it's core, JavaScript is synchronous - single threaded (thread of execution)
 * - Each line of code is executed one line at a time
 * - Single sequential flow of control
 * - JS is a synchronous language with asynchronous capabilities
 * - A thread has a call stack & memory
